**Abstract** \
<ins>Background</ins>:
Arterial wall thickness and stiffness and high blood pressure have been repeatedly associated with poorer brain health. 
However, previous studies largely focused on mid- or late-life stages. It is unknown whether any arterial health-related 
brain changes may be observable already in adolescence. \
<ins>Methods</ins>:
We examined whether (i) carotid intima-media thickness, (ii) carotid distensibility and (iii) systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, measured at age 10, were associated with brain volumes and/or white matter microstructure (i.e., fractional 
anisotropy and mean diffusivity) at age 14. In addition to cross-sectional analyses, we explored associations with 
longitudinal change in each brain outcome from 10 to 14 years. Analyses were based on 5341 children from the Generation 
R Study. \
<ins>Results</ins>: 
Higher diastolic blood pressure was associated with lower total brain (β [95%CI] = -0.04 [-0.07;-0.01]) and grey matter 
volumes (β [95%CI] = -0.04 [-0.07;-0.01]) at age 14 years, with stronger associations in higher diastolic blood pressure 
ranges. Similar associations emerged between systolic blood pressure and brain volumes but these were no longer significant 
after adjusting for birthweight. No associations were observed between blood pressure and white matter microstructure, 
nor between carotid intima-media thickness or distensibility and brain morphology. \
<ins>Conclusions</ins>: 
Arterial blood pressure, but not intima-media thickness and distensibility, is associated with structural neuroimaging 
markers in early adolescence. Volumetric measures may be more sensitive to these early arterial health differences compared 
to microstructural properties of the white matter, but further studies are needed to confirm these results and assess 
potential causal mechanisms.
