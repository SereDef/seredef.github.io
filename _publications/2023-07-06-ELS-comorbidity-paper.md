**Abstract** \
<ins>Objective</ins>:
Depression and obesity are 2 highly prevalent and often comorbid conditions. Exposure to early-life stress (ELS) has 
been associated with both depression and obesity in adulthood, as well as their preclinical manifestations during 
development. However, it remains unclear whether (1) associations differ depending on the timing of stress exposure 
(prenatal vs postnatal), and whether (2) ELS is a shared risk factor underlying the comorbidity between the 2 conditions. \
<ins>Method</ins>:
Leveraging data from 2 large population-based birth cohorts (ALSPAC: n = 8,428 [52% male participants]; Generation R: 
n = 4,268 [48% male participants]), we constructed comprehensive cumulative measures of prenatal (in utero) and postnatal 
(from birth to 10 years) ELS. At age 13.5 years, we assessed the following: internalizing symptoms (using maternal reports); 
fat mass percentage (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry); and their comorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of high 
internalizing and high adiposity. \
<ins>Results</ins>:
Both prenatal (total effect [95% CI] = 0.20 [0.16; 0.22]) and postnatal stress (Î² [95%CI] = 0.22 [0.17; 0.25]) were 
associated with higher internalizing symptoms, with evidence of a more prominent role of postnatal stress. A weaker 
association (driven primarily by prenatal stress) was observed between stress and adiposity (prenatal: 0.07 [0.05; 0.09]; 
postnatal: 0.04 [0.01; 0.07]). Both prenatal (odds ratio [95%CI] = 1.70 [1.47; 1.97]) and postnatal (1.87 [1.61; 2.17]) 
stress were associated with an increased risk of developing comorbidity. \
<ins>Conclusion</ins>:
We found evidence of timing and shared causal effects of ELS on psycho-cardiometabolic health in adolescence; however, 
future research is warranted to clarify how these associations may unfold over time.
