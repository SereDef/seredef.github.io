**Abstract** \

<ins>Background</ins>: Depressive symptoms and cardio-metabolic risk factors often co-occur. However, our 
understanding of the potential mechanisms and temporal dynamics underlying their co-development remains elusive. \
<ins>Methods</ins>: This population-based cohort study examined bidirectional longitudinal associations between 
depressive symptoms and cardio-metabolic risk factors from age 10 to 25 years, using prospective data from the 
ALSPAC Study. Participants with at least one (of six) follow-up measurement for each outcome were included in 
the analyses. We measured depressive symptoms through self- as well as parent-reports, and assessed several 
cardio-metabolic risk factors (including adiposity measures, lipid profiles and inflammation). \
<ins>Results</ins>: Among our 7970 (47% male) participants, we found bidirectional, within-person associations 
between self-reported depressive symptoms and adiposity (i.e., fat/lean mass index, but not body mass index), 
across the study period. Adiposity was more stable over time (Î² [range] = 0.75 [0.54; 0.84]), compared to 
depressive symptoms (0.26 [0.12; 0.38]), and it had a stronger prospective (i.e., cross-lagged) association 
with future depressive symptoms (0.07 [0.03, 0.13]) compared to that between depressive symptom and future 
adiposity (0.04 [0.03, 0.06]). The magnitude of these associations reached its peak between 14 and 16 years. 
We did not find evidence of cross-lagged associations in either direction between depressive symptoms and waist 
circumference, insulin, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol or C-reactive protein. \
<ins>Conclusions</ins>: These findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between depressive symptoms and 
cardio-metabolic risk factors, particularly adiposity (i.e., fat/lean mass). Adiposity showed a stronger 
prospective association with future depressive symptoms, than vice versa, however their relationship revealed 
more reciprocal than previously thought.
