**Abstract**

<ins>Background</ins>:
Recent work suggests that DNA methylation can be used as a proxy of fetal glucocorticoid exposure (MPS-GC), showing 
associations with maternal psychopathology during pregnancy. However, it is unknown whether the MPS-GC may act as 
a marker for broader prenatal stress and whether it partially mediates associations of prenatal stress with child 
internalizing and externalizing symptoms. \
<ins>Methods</ins>:
Using harmonized data from three prospective birth cohorts (Npooled = 6086), we examined whether a cumulative measure 
of prenatal stress, and its individual stress domains, associate with the MPS-GC in cord blood at birth. Next, we 
examined (i) whether the MPS-GC at birth associates with child psychiatric symptoms, (ii) whether this association is 
moderated by postnatal stress, and (iii) whether the effect of prenatal stress on child psychiatric symptoms is 
partially mediated by the MPS-GC at birth. \
<ins>Results</ins>:
Our meta-analysis revealed no significant associations between the MPS-GC at birth and prenatal stress or the 
individual stress domains. Moreover, the MPS-GC did not significantly associate with later child internalizing or 
externalizing symptoms, and there were no moderating effects of postnatal stress. Additionally, while prenatal 
stress significantly associated with child psychiatric symptoms, we found no partial mediation via the MPS-GC at 
birth. \
<ins>Conclusions</ins>:
We did not find support that the MPS-GC in cord blood reliably proxies prenatal stress, associates with child 
psychiatric risk, or partially mediates the associations between prenatal stress and psychiatric risk.
