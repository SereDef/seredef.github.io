**Abstract** \

<ins>Objective</ins>:
Early-life stress (ELS) is an established risk factor for a host of adult mental and physical health problems, including 
both depression and obesity. Recent studies additionally showed that ELS was associated with an increased risk of 
comorbidity between mental and physical health problems, already in adolescence. Healthy lifestyle factors, including 
physical activity, sleep and diet have also been robustly linked to both emotional and physical wellbeing. However, it 
is yet unclear whether these lifestyle factors may moderate the association between ELS and psycho-physical comorbidity. \
<ins>Methods</ins>:
We investigated whether (a) participation in physical activity, (b) sleep duration, and (c) adherence to a Mediterranean 
diet, moderated the relationship between cumulative ELS exposure over the first 10 years of life and psycho-physical 
comorbidity at the age of 13.5 years. Analyses were conducted in 2022â€“2023, using data from two large adolescent samples 
based in the UK (ALSPAC; n = 8428) and The Netherlands (Generation R; n = 4268). \
<ins>Results</ins>: 
Exposure to ELS was significantly associated with a higher risk of developing comorbidity, however this association was 
not modified by any of the three lifestyle factors investigated. Only physical activity was significantly associated with 
a reduced risk of comorbidity in one cohort (ORALSPAC [95%CI] = 0.73 [0.59;0.89]). \
<ins>Conclusions</ins>:
In conclusion, while we found some evidence that more frequent physical activity may be associated with a reduction in 
psycho-physical comorbidity, we did not find evidence in support of the hypothesised moderation effects. However, more 
research is warranted to examine how these associations may evolve over time.
