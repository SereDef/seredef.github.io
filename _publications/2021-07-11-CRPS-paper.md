**Abstract**:
Body perceptual disturbances are an increasingly acknowledged set of symptoms and possible clinical markers of complex 
regional pain syndrome (CRPS), but the neurophysiological and neurocognitive changes that underlie them are still far 
from being clear. We adopted a multivariate and neurodynamical approach to the analysis of EEG modulations evoked by 
touch to highlight differences between patients and healthy controls, between affected and unaffected side of the body, 
and between "passive" (i.e., no task demands and equiprobable digit stimulation) and "active" tactile processing (i.e., 
where a digit discrimination task was administered and spatial probability manipulated). When correct identifications 
are considered, an early reduction in cortical decodability (28-56 ms) distinguishes CRPS patients from healthy 
volunteers. However, when error trials are included in the classifier's training, there is an unexpected increased 
decodability in the CRPS group compared with healthy volunteers (280-320 ms). These group differences in neural 
processing seemed to be driven by the affected rather than the unaffected side. We corroborated these findings with 
several exploratory analyses of neural representation dynamics and behavioural modelling, highlighting the need for 
single participant analyses. Although several limitations impacted the robustness and generalizability of these comparisons, 
the proposed analytical approach yielded promising insights (as well as possible biomarkers based on neural dynamics) 
into the relatively unexplored alterations of tactile decision-making and attentional control mechanisms in chronic CRPS.
