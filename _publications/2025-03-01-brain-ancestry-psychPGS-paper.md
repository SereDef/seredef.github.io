**Abstract** \

While psychiatric disorders share genetic and neurobiological underpinnings, their manifestation during 
childhood and adolescence, particularly in diverse populations, remains poorly understood. Using whole-brain 
vertex-wise analyses in two independent pediatric cohorts representing African, Hispanic/Latinx, and European 
ancestries (N=8,767, with 13,769 brain scans), we investigated neurobiological signatures of pleiotropic 
genetic risk underlying fifteen psychiatric disorders. Higher polygenic risk for the Internalizing 
Factor (INTGF), capturing susceptibility to depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder in 
adults, was associated with reduced cortical surface areas in the superior frontal, medial orbitofrontal, 
and cingulate regions, and smaller left amygdala volumes across ancestries in adolescents. At age thirteen, 
INTGF was associated with a broad spectrum of adolescent psychopathology, with reduced cortical surface 
area at age ten mediating this relationship. These findings uncover conserved neurodevelopmental pathways 
linking pleiotropic genetic risk to brain alterations and mental health problems detectable as early as 
adolescence, highlighting potential targets for early intervention across diverse populations.
