Hi! This is a little personal website that collects some of the projects I have been working on as part of my PhD (or just
for the fun of it).

If you nose around here, you can find [academic publications](/publications/), some [software](/software/) and [web applications](/software/), 
[talks](/talks/), [tutorials](/talks/) and loads of [interactive notebooks](/portfolio/) and other (big and small) analyses that I have been 
playing around with.

If you have any questions, notes, suggestions or just want to have a chat, please contact me on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/serena-defina-684378183/), check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/SereDef), or just drop me 
an email. 

### If you have time for background stories...
Bit of an artsy kid, grown up in the middle-of-nowhere Italian South, excited about philosophy, literature and painting 
(which made for an _unbearable_ teen). 
I ended up studying Psychology in my Bachelor, and those undergrad years were the breading ground for two new passions: 
one was statistics and the other was the brain. \
So I got my hands on a scholarship and headed all the way to Amsterdam where I specialized in Neuroscience. There I met 
machine learning for the first time and - like anybody else in early 2010s - I was just hooked. So, my first little data projects
were all about applying these new ML techniques to brain time-series data, first in Amsterdam (MRI) and then in Cambridge (EEG). \
I then moved on to Rotterdam where I started whole new PhD adventure. I got the chance to specialize further in Epidemiology and learned 
a great deal about causal inference and exciting new techniques, questions and datasets, such as clinical and genetic data. 
In my PhD, I try to combine the world of causal inference with that of prediction to understand how some people develop mental 
disorders that are comorbid with cardio-metabolic problems and others don't.
