Hi! This is a little personal website that collects some of the projects I have been working on as part of my job (or just
for the fun of it).

If you nose around here, you can find [academic publications](/publications/), some [software](/software/) and [web applications](/software/), 
[talks](/talks/), [tutorials](/talks/), [interactive notebooks](/portfolio/) and other (big and small) analyses that I have been 
playing around with.

If you have any questions, notes, suggestions or just want to have a chat, please contact me on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/serena-defina-684378183/), check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/SereDef), or just drop me 
an email. 

### If you have time for background stories...
Bit of an artsy kid, grown up in the middle-of-nowhere Italian South, with the (questionable) blessing of little-to-no 
entertainment, which got me very excited about literature and philosophy. So I ended up studying Psychology in my 
Bachelor. Those undergrad years were the breading ground for the two passions that still get me going today: 
one was statistics and the other was the brain. \
So I got my hands on a scholarship and headed all the way to Amsterdam where I specialized in Neuroscience. There I met 
machine learning for the first time and - like anybody else in early 2010s - I was hooked. \
My first data projects were all about applying these new ML techniques to brain time-series data, first in 
Amsterdam (MRI) and then in Cambridge (EEG). I then moved on to Rotterdam where I started whole new PhD adventure. 
I specialized further in Epidemiology and learned a great deal about Causal Inference. I also really grew my data 
analysis arsenal with exciting new techniques, questions and datasets (such as clinical and genomic data). \
I currently work as a Data Scientist / Research Software Engineer for the Erasmus Medical Center.
