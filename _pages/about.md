Hi! This is a little personal website that collects some of the projects I have been working on as part of my PhD (or just
for the fun of it).

If you nose around here, you can find [academic publications](/publications/), some software and web applications, talks, tutorials and 
loads of interactive notebooks and other (big and small) analyses that I have been playing around with.

If you have any questions, notes, suggestions or just want to have a chat, please contact me on LinkedIn or just drop me 
an email. 

A little about me
======
Bit of an artsy kid grown up in the middle-of-nowhere Italian South, I would get very excited about visual arts, literature 
and philosophy (which made for an admittedly unbearable teenager). I ended up studying Psychology in my Bachelor, and those 
undergrad years were breading ground for two new passions: statistics and the brain. So I got my hands on a scholarship and 
headed all the way to Amsterdam where I could specialize in Neuroscience. That is where I met ML for the first tile and (like 
anybody else in 2015) got really excited about it. So my first little projects with data were about applying these new ML 
techniques to brain data (MRI and EEG timeseries) which was very fun. I then moved on to Rotterdam where I was following a
new curiosity: genetic (and what I later learned to call omics data). I got the change to specialize further in epidemiology 
and learned a great deal about causal inference and new techniques. 
In my PhD, I try to combine the world of causal inference with that of prediction to understand how some people develop mental 
disorders that are comorbid with cardio-metabolic problems and others don't.
